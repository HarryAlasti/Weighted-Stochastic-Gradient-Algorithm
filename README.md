# Prepared and uploaded by H. Alasti - July 2020
# Efficient spatial tracking of spatial signals based on Weighted Stochastic Gradient method
#

This folder includes the simulation code for Weighted Stochastic Gradient based spatial tracking.

1) Main MATLAB script to run: Sim_200_7_7_1.m

2) Lloyd-Max function: Lloyd_Max_2.m

3) Spatial signal generator: Wave_Generator.m
   Please change the spatial signal attribute by changing: Sigma for large scale and Ss for small scale Gaussians 
   Copy the generated spatial signals in the same folder of Sim_200_7_7_1.m

4) Wave_Plot.m: You may plot one spatial signal by running Wave_Plot.m that is copied in the same spatial signal folder.

5) Running the code:
   Run the code under MATLAB and please be patient.

   Thanks for your interest.
